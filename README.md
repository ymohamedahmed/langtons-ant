# Langton's Ant
A program to display the two-dimensional Turing machine known as Langton's ant. It is particularly interesting since, although initially behaviour appears chaotic, it eventually displays a regular pattern which is shown below.
## Rules
* Every square on the grid is either black or white (the square with the ant is coloured red for convenience). 
* At a white square the ant turns right by 90 degrees and inverts the colour of the square
* At a black square the ant turns left by 90 degrees and inverts the colour of the square
